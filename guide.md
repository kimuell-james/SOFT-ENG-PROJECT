Great! Here's a clean and **well-structured breakdown** of your expected outputs, suggestions for **better ordering**, and whether each should be presented **per grade level or as a whole**:

## ‚úÖ **Refined Expected Outputs**

| **#** | **Output**                                | **Suggested Scope**     | **Purpose** |
|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | **Track Rate Distribution**                | ‚úÖ Whole dataset         | Shows the proportion of students per track (Academic vs TVL). |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | **Correlation Matrix**                     | ‚úÖ Whole dataset         | Identifies highly correlated subjects to understand redundancy. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | **Feature Selection**                      | ‚úÖ Per grade level       | Reveals which subjects at each grade best separate tracks. |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | **Feature Importance from Logistic Regression** | ‚úÖ Per grade level   | Shows model-learned weights for selected features. |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | **Confusion Matrix**                        | ‚úÖ Per grade level       | Evaluates how well the model distinguishes tracks. |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£  | **Classification Report**                   | ‚úÖ Per grade level       | Precision, recall, F1-score to assess model performance. |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£  | **ROC Curve and AUC Score**                 | ‚úÖ Per grade level       | Visualizes model performance; best for binary classification. |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£  | **Grade-wise Contribution of Selected Subjects** | ‚úÖ Summary Table across grades | Shows which subjects (e.g., Grade 7 Math) are most consistently selected or weighted. |

## üìä **Suggested Order of Presentation (Final Report / Dashboard)**

1. **Track Rate Distribution**  
2. **Correlation Matrix**  
3. **Feature Selection (per grade)**  
4. **Feature Importance (per grade)**  
5. **Grade-Level Subject Contribution Summary** ‚úÖ *(new addition)*  
6. **Logistic Regression Performance** (repeat per grade level):  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report  
   - ROC Curve + AUC Score  
7. **Prediction Progression Visualization** *(Optional bonus)*

## üîç **Grade-wise Subject Contribution Output Example**

You can print or visualize a summary like this:

| Subject      | Grade | Selected | Feature Importance Rank |
|--------------|-------|----------|--------------------------|
| Math         | 7     | ‚úÖ       | 1                        |
| TLE          | 8     | ‚úÖ       | 2                        |
| Science      | 9     | ‚úÖ       | 3                        |
| ESP          | 10    | ‚ùå       | -                        |

Or group them like:

```
Top Contributing Subjects by Grade Level:
- Grade 7: Math, English
- Grade 8: TLE, Science
- Grade 9: Math, Filipino
- Grade 10: Science, AP
```
