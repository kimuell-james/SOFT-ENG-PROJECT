st.markdown("### 🧾 Project Overview")
st.write("""
This system uses Logistic Regression to predict the most suitable Senior High School (SHS) track—Academic or TVL—for Junior High School students based on their academic performance and profile from Grades 7 to 10. By analyzing grade-level data, the model helps identify which track aligns best with a student's strengths, offering insights at each stage of their academic journey.

- 📥 **Data Overview** page to explore and understand the structure, features, and distribution of the student dataset.
- 🧠 **Feature Selection** page to identify the most relevant academic and demographic factors that influence Senior High School track predictions.
- 🤖 **Logistic Regression Model** page to analyze predictions based on the selected features and visualize the model’s decision outcomes.
- 🎯 **Evaluation Metrics** page to assess the model’s performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.
- 📊 **Balanced Logistic Regression Model** page to page to address class imbalance applying `class_weight='balanced'` and improve prediction fairness across student groups.
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics for Balanced Model** page to evaluate the balanced model’s performance and compare it with the baseline model.
